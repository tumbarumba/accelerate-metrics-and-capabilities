                    To remain competive and excel in the market, organisations must accelerate:
                    <ul>
                        <li>delivery of goods and services to delight our customers</li>
                        <li>engagement with the market to detect and understand customer demand</li>
                        <li>anticipation of compliance and regulartory changes that impact their systems</li>
                        <li>response to potential risks such as security threats or changes in the economy</li>
                    </ul>
                    We will be looking at metrics to focus on in driving the acceleration, and the capabilities
                    that will most enable successful acceleration.

                        Version control is the use of a version control system, such as GitHub or Subversion, for
                        all production artifacts, including application code, application configurations, and
                        scripts for automating build and configuration of the environment.

                        Deployment automation is the degree to which deployments are fully automated and do not
                        require manual intervention.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        CI is the first step towards continuous delivery. This is a development practice where the
                        code is regularly checked in, and each check in triggers a set of quick tests to discover
                        serious regressions, which developers fix immediately. The CI process creates canonical
                        builds and packages that are ultimately deployed and released.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Trunk-based development has been shown to be a predictor or high performance in software
                        development and delivery. It is characterised by fewer than three active branches in a code
                        repository; branches and forks having very short lifetimes (e.g., less than a day) before
                        being merged to main; and applications teams rarely or never having "code lock" periods
                        when no one can check in or do pull requests due to merging conflicts, code freezes, or
                        stabilisation phases.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        This is a practice where software tests are run automatically (not manually) continuously
                        throughout the development process. Effective test suites are reliable - this is, tests
                        find real failures and only pass releasable code. Note that developers should be primarily
                        reponsible for creation and maintenance of automated test suites.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Test data requires careful maintenance, and test data management is becoming an increasingly
                        important part of automated testing. Effictive practices include having adequate test data
                        to run your test suite, the ability to acquire necessary data on demand, the ablity to
                        condition your test data in your pipeline, and the data not limited the amount of tests you
                        can run. We do caution, however, that teams should minimise, whenever possible, the amount
                        of test data needed to run automated tests.

                        Integration security into the design and testing phases of the software development process
                        is key to driving IT performance. This includes conducting secruity reviews of applications,
                        including the infosec team in the design and demo process for applications, using
                        preapproved security libraries and packages, and testing security features as part of the
                        automated test suite.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        CD is a development practice where software is in a deployable state throughout its
                        lifecycle, and the team prioritises keeping the sofware ina deployable state over working
                        on new features. Fast feedback on the quality and deployability of the system is available
                        to all teams members, and when they get reports that the system isn't deployable, fixes are
                        made quickly. Finally, the system can be deployed to production or end users at any time,
                        on demand.

                        without requiring orchestration with other services. Having a loosly coupled architecture
                        allows your teams to work independantly, without relying on other teams for support and
                        services, which in turn enables them to work quickly and deliver value to the organisation.

                        Software delivery performance markedly better in organisations that actively and regularly
                        seek customer feedback and incorporate this feedback into the design of their products.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Teams should have a good understanding of and visibility into the flow of work from the
                        business all the way through to customers, including the status of products and features.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Teams should slice work into small pieces that can be completed in a week or less. The key
                        is to have work decomposed into small features that allow for rapid development, instead of
                        developing complex features on branches and releasing them infrequently. This idea can be
                        applied at the feature and the product level.<br>
                        <br>
                        Working in small batches enables short lead times and faster feedback loops.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        This is the ability of deveopers to try out new ideas and create and update specifications
                        during the development process, without requiring approval from outside of the team, which
                        allows them to innovate quickly and create value.<br>
                        <br>
                        This is particularly impactful when combined with working in small batches, incorporating
                        customer feedback, and making the flow of work visible.

                        This measure of organisational culture is based on a typology developed by Ron Westrum, a

                        healthcare. Our research has found that this mesure of culture is predictive of IT
                        performance, organisational performance, and decreasing burnout. Hallmarks of this measure
                        include good information flow, high cooperation and trust, bridging between teams, and
                        conscious inquiry.
